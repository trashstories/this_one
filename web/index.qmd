# research

<div style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify">

Welcome to my portfolio of research and graphic design. My research goals have been focused on exposing systemic racism as feature, not a bug, in American societies from the first settler-colonialist to the present day. Patriarchal white supremacy is baked into the foundation of the systems that govern our lives; from criminal justice to social services, racist and sexist biases are inherent. In order to break down these oppressive structures, they must first be identified and understood.

Analytics Dumpster Research for Equity with an Abolitionist Mindset, an image of a raccoon next to a dumpster with data icons in and around it with the caption 'Turn your trash data into treasure!'"}](https://rpubs.com/trashability/dream)

DREAM Analytics is a moniker that I work under in my personal time to offer my data skills to non-profit and grassroots organizations at low or no costs. 

Ideally, I hope to grow this into a network of data activists to share skills and support the greater movement for abolition of the prison industrial complex and the white supremacist systems rooted in settler-colonialism that perpetuate harm and have committed genocide on the continent known as North America for centuries against anyone outside the white anglo protestant elite, most notably against Indigenous and African people. 

Email me at [trashability56@gmail.com](mailto:trashability56@gmail.com) if you are interested in collaborating. I am on Instagram but not very active, but I will reply to DMs and welcome followers [@trashability56](https://www.instagram.com/trashability56) (I usually post pup photos and examples of my graphics).
