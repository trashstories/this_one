DREAM Analytics is a moniker that I work under in my personal time to offer my data skills to non-profit and grassroots organizations at low or no costs. 

Ideally, I hope to grow this into a network of data activists to share skills and support the greater movement for abolition of the prison industrial complex and the white supremacist systems rooted in settler-colonialism that perpetuate harm and have committed genocide on the continent known as North America for centuries against anyone outside the white anglo protestant elite, most notably against Indigenous and African people. 

Email me at [trashability56@gmail.com](mailto:trashability56@gmail.com) if you are interested in collaborating. I am on Instagram but not very active, but I will reply to DMs and welcome followers [@trashability56](https://www.instagram.com/trashability56) (I usually post pup photos and examples of my graphics).
