# Who We Are

<div style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify">

DREAM Analytics is a trailblazing data consulting organization committed to promoting equity and justice through innovative data solutions. Our acronym, DREAM, reflects our mission: Dumpster Research for Equity with an Abolitionist Mindset. The idea of “dumpster research” comes from the broken and often discarded bits of information that make up data. Distinguishing trash from treasure is merely a matter of perspective, and I want to go treasure hunting in the data your team creates doing their important work! Rooted in an abolitionist framework, we collaborate directly with organizations, empowering them to harness the full potential of their data for meaningful impact. 

DREAM Analytics envisions a world where data can be a driving force for equity, justice, and the abolition of oppressive systems. Data has the power to convey the importance and benefits of the implementation of policies and practices that utilize strategies for transformative and restorative justice. Together with the organizations we partner with, we embark on a transformative journey, turning data dreams into actionable realities that positively impact communities and contribute to a more just and equitable society.

DREAM Analytics is committed to making these crucial services available to any organization with a mission aligned with our values. All services are provided on sliding scale, including pro bono when possible, depending on the services provided, the size and resources of the organization, and our own resources and capacity.
