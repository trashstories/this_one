Why is a Normal prior a reasonable choice for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$? **Because they are independent**\nb. Why isn’t a Normal prior a reasonable choice for $\\sigma$? **Because it is exponential**\nc. What’s the difference between weakly informative and vague priors? **Weakly informative priors are more focused and reasonable than vague priors, which can sometimes weight non-sensible parameter values.**\n\n## Exercise 9.2 (Identify the variable) \n\nIdentify the response variable ($Y$) and predictor variable ($X$) in each given relationship of interest.\n\na. We want to use a person’s arm length to understand their height. **$Y$ = height, $X$ = arm length**\nb. We want to predict a person’s carbon footprint (in annual CO$_2$ emissions) with the distance between their home and work. **$Y$ = carbon footprint, $X$ = distance from home to work**\nc. We want to understand how a child’s vocabulary level might increase with age. **$Y$ = vocabulary, $X$ = age**\nd. We want to use information about a person’s sleep habits to predict their reaction time. **$Y$ = reaction time, $X$ = sleep habits**\n\n## Exercise 9.3 (Interpreting coefficients) \n\nIn each situation below, suppose that the typical relationship between the given response variable $Y$ and predictor $X$ can be described by $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X$. Interpret the meaning of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ and indicate whether your prior understanding suggests that $\\beta_1$ is negative or positive.\n\na. $Y$ = height in cm of a baby kangaroo, $X$ = its age in months **$\\beta_0$ is the expected height of a kangaroo at 0 months, $\\beta_1$ is the amount of expected growth for each month increase, and prior understanding suggests that it is positive**\nb. $Y$ = a data scientist’s number of GitHub followers, $X$ = their number of GitHub commits in the past week **$\\beta_0$ is the expected number of a followers if they had 0 commits in the past week, $\\beta_1$ is the amount of expected followers for each additional commit, and prior understanding suggests that it is positive**\nc. $Y$ = number of visitors to a local park on a given day, $X$ = rainfall in inches on that day **$\\beta_0$ is the expected number of visitors if there is 0 inches of rainfall, $\\beta_1$ is the amount of expected change in visitors with each inch increase of rainfall, and prior understanding suggests that it is negative**\nd. $Y$ = the daily hours of Netflix that a person watches, $X$ = the typical number of hours that they sleep **$\\beta_0$ is the expected daily hours of Netflix watched, $\\beta_1$ is the amount of expected change in the number of hours they sleep, and prior understanding is uncertain about whether $beta_1$ is positive or negative**\n\n## Exercise 9.4 (Deviation from the average) \n\nConsider the Normal regression model (9.6). Explain in one or two sentences, in a way that one of your non-stats friends could understand, how $\\sigma$ is related to the strength of the relationship between a response variable $Y$ and predictor $X$. \n\n**$\\sigma$ is related to the strength of the relationship between $Y$ and $X$ because it represents the exceptional value of the variability in the distribution, or standard deviation from the mean.**\n\n## Exercise 9.5 (Bayesian model building: Part I) \n\nA researcher wants to use a person’s age (in years) to predict their annual orange juice consumption (in gallons). Here you’ll build up a relevant Bayesian regression model, step by step.\n\na. Identify the $Y$ and $X$ variables in this study. **$Y$ = orange juice consumption, $X$ = age**\nb. Use mathematical notation to specify an appropriate structure for the model of data $Y$ (ignoring $X$ for now). **UNSURE ABOUT THIS ONE**\nc. Rewrite the structure of the data model to incorporate information about predictor $X$. In doing so, assume there’s a linear relationship between $Y$ and $X$. **$\\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i$**\nd. Identify all unknown parameters in your model. For each, indicate the values the parameter can take. **$\\mu_i$ = expected orange juice consumption, $\\beta_0$ = expected orange juice consumption if age is 0, $\\beta_1$ = expected change in orange juice consumption with each increase in age by one year - UNSURE ABOUT VALUES**\ne. Identify and tune suitable prior models for your parameters. Explain your rationale. ****\n\n## Exercise 9.6 (Bayesian model building: Part II) \n\nRepeat the above exercise for the following scenario. A researcher wishes to predict tomorrow’s high temperature by today’s high temperature.\n\n## Exercise 9.7 (Posterior simulation T/F) \n\nMark each statement about posterior regression simulation as True or False.\n\na. MCMC provides the exact posterior model of our regression parameters ($\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1 X$, $\\sigma$). **FALSE: MCMC provides an approximate posterior model**\nb. MCMC allows us to avoid complicated mathematical derivations. **What exactly is mathematical derivations?**\n\n## Exercise 9.8 (Posterior simulation) \n\nFor each situation, specify the appropriate `stan_glm()` syntax for simulating the Normal regression model using 4 chains, each of length 10000. (You won’t actually run any code.)\n\na. $X$ = `age`; $Y$ = `height`; dataset name: `bunnies`\n\n```\nstan_glm(\n  height ~ age, data = bunnies, \n  family = gaussian,\n  prior_intercept = normal(10, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),\n  prior = normal(1, .5, autoscale = TRUE), \n  prior_aux = exponential(1, autoscale = TRUE),\n  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2, seed = 80085)\n```\n\nb. $\\text{Clicks}_i | \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma \\sim N\\left(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2\\right) \\;\\; \\text{ with } \\;\\; \\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Snaps}_i$; dataset name: `songs`.\n\n```\nstan_glm(\n  Clicks ~ Snaps, data = songs, \n  family = gaussian,\n  prior_intercept = normal(1000, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),\n  prior = normal(100, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE), \n  prior_aux = exponential(1, autoscale = TRUE),\n  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2, seed = 80085)\n```\n\nc. $\\text{Happiness}_i | \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma \\sim N\\left(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2\\right) \\;\\; \\text{ with } \\;\\; \\mu_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Age}_i$; dataset name: `dogs`.\n\n```\nstan_glm(\n  Happiness ~ Age, data = dogs, \n  family = gaussian,\n  prior_intercept = normal(5, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),\n  prior = normal(1, .5, autoscale = TRUE), \n  prior_aux = exponential(1, autoscale = TRUE),\n  chains = 4, iter = 5000*2, seed = 80085)\n```\n",
