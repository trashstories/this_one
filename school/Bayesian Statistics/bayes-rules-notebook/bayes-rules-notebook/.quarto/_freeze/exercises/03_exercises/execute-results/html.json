Compare, in words, the salespeople’s prior understandings about the proportion of U.S. residents that say “pop.”\n\n**The first salesperson believes that many US residents say \"pop,\" and the second salesperson believes that very few US residents say \"pop.\"**\n\n## 3.8.2 Practice: Beta-Binomial models\n\n### Exercise 3.10 (Different priors, different posteriors) \n\nContinuing Exercise 3.9, we poll 50 U.S. residents and 12 (24%) prefer the term “pop.”\n\na. Specify the unique posterior model of $\\pi$ for both salespeople. We encourage you to construct these posteriors from scratch.\n\n**eeek**\n\nb.

Compare the salespeople’s posterior understanding of $\\pi$.\n\nThe first salesperson's posterior understanding of $\\pi$ is much lower than the prior model. However, the second salesperson estimated too low in the prior model, but they were closer to the polls results, thus, the posterior understanding did not change as much as the first salesperson.\n\n\n",
