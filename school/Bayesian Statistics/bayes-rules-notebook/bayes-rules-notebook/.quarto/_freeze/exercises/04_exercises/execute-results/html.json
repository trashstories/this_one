The local ice cream shop is open until it runs out of ice cream for the day. It’s 2 p.m. and Chad wants to pick up an ice cream cone. He asks his coworkers about the chance ($\\pi$) that the shop is still open. Their Beta priors for $\\pi$ are below:\n\ncoworker  |  prior\n---------------------------\nKimya     |  Beta(1, 2)\nFernando\t|  Beta(0.5, 1)\nCiara\t    |  Beta(3, 10)\nTaylor\t  |  Beta(2, 0.1)\n\n### Exercise 4.4 (Choice of prior) \n\nVisualize and summarize (in words) each coworker’s prior understanding of Chad’s chances to satisfy his ice cream craving.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nk <- plot_beta(1, 2)\nf <- plot_beta(.5, 1)\nc <- plot_beta(3, 10)\nt <- plot_beta(2, .1)\n\nk + f + c + t\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- K is pretty sure it is *not* open.\n- F is almost certain it is *not* open.\n- C is confident but not sure it is *not* open.\n- T is very certain that it *is* open.\n\n### Exercise 4.5 (Simulating the posterior) \n\nChad peruses the shop’s website. On 3 of the past 7 days, they were still open at 2 p.m.. Complete the following for each of Chad’s coworkers:\n\n- simulate their posterior model;\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nk1 <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 1, beta = 2, y = 3, n = 7)\nf1 <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = .5, beta = 1, y = 3, n = 7)\nc1 <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 3, beta = 10, y = 3, n = 7)\nt1 <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 2, beta = .1, y = 3, n = 7)\n\nk1 / f1 / c1 / t1 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04_exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- create a histogram for the simulated posterior; and\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n- use the simulation to approximate the posterior mean value of $\\pi$.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Exercise 4.6 (Identifying the posterior) \n\nComplete the following for each of Chad’s coworkers:\n\n- identify the exact posterior model of $\\pi$;\n- calculate the exact posterior mean of $\\pi$; and\n- compare these to the simulation results in the previous exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
