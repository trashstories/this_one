One of the most notable things about ginkgo trees is that they shed all of their leaves at the same time, usually after the first frost.

The local ice cream shop is open until it runs out of ice cream for the day. It’s 2 p.m. and Chad wants to pick up an ice cream cone. He asks his coworkers about the chance ($\\pi$) that the shop is still open. Their Beta priors for $\\pi$ are below:\n\ncoworker  |  prior\n---------------------------\nKimya     |  Beta(1, 2)\nFernando\t|  Beta(0.5, 1)\nCiara\t    |  Beta(3, 10)\nTaylor\t  |  Beta(2, 0.1)\n\n### Exercise 4.4 (Choice of prior) \n\nVisualize and summarize (in words) each coworker’s prior understanding of Chad’s chances to satisfy his ice cream craving.\n\n```{r}\n\nk <- plot_beta(1, 2)\nf <- plot_beta(.5, 1)\nc <- plot_beta(3, 10)\nt <- plot_beta(2, .1)\n\nk + f + c + t\n\n```\n\n- K is pretty sure it is *not* open.\n- F is almost certain it is *not* open.\n- C is confident but not sure it is *not* open.\n- T is very certain that it *is* open.\n\n### Exercise 4.5 (Simulating the posterior) \n\nChad peruses the shop’s website. On 3 of the past 7 days, they were still open at 2 p.m.. Complete the following for each of Chad’s coworkers:\n\n- simulate their posterior model;\n```{r}\n\nk1 <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 1, beta = 2, y = 3, n = 7)\nf1 <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = .5, beta = 1, y = 3, n = 7)\nc1 <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 3, beta = 10, y = 3, n = 7)\nt1 <- plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 2, beta = .1, y = 3, n = 7)\n\nk1 / f1 / c1 / t1 \n\n```\n\n- create a histogram for the simulated posterior; and\n```{r}\n\n```\n\n- use the simulation to approximate the posterior mean value of $\\pi$.\n```{r}\n\n```\n\n\n### Exercise 4.6 (Identifying the posterior) \n\nComplete the following for each of Chad’s coworkers:\n\n- identify the exact posterior model of $\\pi$;\n- calculate the exact posterior mean of $\\pi$; and\n- compare these to the simulation results in the previous exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(bayesrules)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n```\n\n## 4.9.1 Review exercises\n\n### Exercise 4.1 (Match the prior to the description)\n\nFive different prior models for $\\pi$ are listed below.
