If the bus is late, Li Qiang will be late to work. To learn about the probability that her bus will be late ($\\pi$), Li Qiang first surveys 20 other commuters:  \n3 think $\\pi$ is 0.15,  \n3 think $\\pi$ is 0.25,  \n8 think $\\pi$ is 0.5,  \n3 think $\\pi$ is 0.75, and  \n3 think $\\pi$ is 0.85.\n\na.

It correctly identifies 80% of cat images as cats, but falsely identifies 50% of non-cat images as cats. Zainab tests her algorithm with a new set of images, 8% of which are cats. What’s the probability that an image is actually a cat if the algorithm identifies it as a cat?
