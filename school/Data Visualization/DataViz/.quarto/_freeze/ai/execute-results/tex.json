From alternate histories and the \"what if...\" questions about the nature of society, to distant planets and unimaginable technological advancement, storytellers have used the genre of science fiction to explore the many nuances of humanity and even what it means to be human. \n\nAn increasingly popular technology, that no longer feels too distant, featured in the genre is artificial intelligence. Stories and the theoretical pontifications about artificial intelligence often explore ideas around what it means to be human, what it means to be flawed, designed, born, manufactured; these stories often deconstruct these ideas as an allegory for the dangers and benefits of technology and human influence in its use in society. Science fiction can take these constructs, that feel like truth in the real world, and change just one (or many) truths about the world to create a place to reexamine what the truth of these ideas really mean. As the portrayal of AI characters has increased in popularity, the characters’ intentions have become increasingly subjective.\n\nIt is important to remember how fiction and media may reflect aspects of reality, it also influences the audience and society at large; the cycle continues to evolve as society values and ideals change over time. Sometimes the creators of popular science fiction intend to persuade the audience about the value or danger of new technology or theory, or the nature of mankind; other times, the message may be subtle and unintentional. Over the last century, science fiction, in its many forms has imagined many different ideas about what artificial intelligence might look like; is it a tool to make life easier for humans, a weapon, alive, does it have free will, does it love? The answers to these questions change over time, as technology catches up with fiction and cultural values evolve, what do science fiction creators say about artificial intelligence and gender? \n\nIn a genre dominated by men, from cultures and societies embedded with patriarchal values, the idea of an all-knowing, all-powerful, man-made sentient being would be an ally to the human race or an enemy cannot be linked directly to the perceived gender of the artificially intelligent being, but perhaps to the body the being inhabits. \n\nFeminine artificial intelligence characters may not be more likely to be an enemy of humanity. After all, femininity goes hand-in-hand with caretakers, nurturers, and teachers, so it follows that a being with those traits and unlimited knowledge could be helpful and supportive of the human agenda. However, that only seems to apply if the artificially intelligent character lacks a corporal body (Jane from the *Ender's Saga* novels, Samantha from *Her*); feminine AI characters with a physical body are almost always either weaponized by their creator (Maria from *Metropolis*) or, more commonly, become aware of their power and aim to use it either to destroy humans or at best, defend themselves or their own desires (Ava from *Ex Machina*, Dolores Abernathy and others from *Westworld*). Whether it is a femme fatale trope, or some other issue male creators have with powerful femininity, feminine AI characters with a corporal form are almost always at least subjective in their motives (with one exception in the new TV series, *Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles*).\n\nAI made its first appearance in science fiction in the German expressionism film, *Metropolis*, in 1925. Author of the novel and screenplay, Thea von Harbou created “Maria,” a robot created in the likeness of the woman leading a workers' uprising to carry out the desires of human male characters. Though men have dominated the genre since the 1940s, in recent years female creators of fiction have found a place for AI love interests at the intersection of romance novels and science fiction. Who wouldn’t want to fall in love with a man perfectly engineered to love them specifically?\n\nOverall, masculine AI characters were most common, and of those whose intentions were clear, they were more likely to be on the side of humanity. Almost half of feminine AI characters did not have clear intentions, and of those who did, they were a bit more likely to be evil. Characters without a perceived gender (who also usually did not have a corporal body) were generally more likely to be good.\n\nWhether internalized or overt, gender roles and perceptions of gendered bodies seem to influence the nature of powerful characters; femininity can only include power and intelligence if she has no body to be sexualized or weaponized. This reflects a real-world environment where powerful women must appear feminine and allow themselves to be sexualized, or risk being perceived as a threat or incompetent, or worse. Creators of science fiction can create a world in any way that they choose, it's time to see more powerful femininity that is not dangerous.\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n# Data background\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\ncolors <- c(\"#7400CC\", \"#CC0AA4\", \"#3ACC14\")\ncolors1 <- c(\"#CCAC14\", \"#0E0ACC\")\n\ngs4_deauth()\n\nai_raw <- read_sheet(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1USWtSVkrXOklfCcts7sH50JemB3Y4OwEmbYuT-Z-z0c/edit#gid=235841052\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nI collected the data via an informal survey of friends, online science fiction communities, and different \"Best of\" lists for different mediums to compile a list of popular publications involving AI characters from the last 100 years. The list included individual characters who are crucial to the plot of the story. Armies or swarms of AI robots were not included; Star Wars droids were also excluded because there are way too many characters from one source. The data collected for each character included the name of AI character, source material, medium, adapted, creator, creator's gender,\tcountry of origin, year, AI's perceived gender, gender explicitly defined, intentions toward humans, corporal body, and any notes for context. I did not use all of these variables in my graphic, but since I was unsure what I would find, I chose to collect extra information, just in case. Adaptations were only used more than once if there were substantial changes made to the story or key characters.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nai_raw %>% \n  filter(list == \"Yes\") %>% \n  select(`Name of AI`, Source, Medium, `AI's perceived gender`, \n         `Intentions toward humans`,`Corporal body`) %>% \n  kable(caption = \"Sample of data for AI characters\") %>% \n  column_spec(1, width = \"5em\") %>% \n  column_spec(2, width = \"7em\") %>% \n  column_spec(3, width = \"5.25em\") %>% \n  column_spec(4, width = \"7em\") %>% \n  column_spec(5, width = \"5.25em\") %>% \n  column_spec(6, width = \"3.5em\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\n\\caption{\\label{tab:table}Sample of data for AI characters}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{5em}|>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{7em}|>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{5.25em}|>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{7em}|>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{5.25em}|>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{3.5em}}\n\\hline\nName of AI & Source & Medium & AI's perceived gender & Intentions toward humans & Corporal body\\\\\n\\hline\nMaria & Metropolis & book & Feminine & Bad & Yes\\\\\n\\hline\nMike (Michelle) & The Moon is a Harsh Mistress & book & Nonbinary / Undetermined & Good & No\\\\\n\\hline\nRachael & Blade Runner & film & Feminine & Subjective & Yes\\\\\n\\hline\nJane & Ender's Saga & novel series & Feminine & Good & No\\\\\n\\hline\nT-800 & Terminator 2: Judgment Day & film & Masculine & Good & Yes\\\\\n\\hline\nBender & Futurama & TV series & Masculine & Subjective & Yes\\\\\n\\hline\nGLADOS & Portal & video game & Feminine & Subjective & Yes\\\\\n\\hline\nAva & Ex Machina & film & Feminine & Bad & Yes\\\\\n\\hline\nSecUnit & All Systems Red & book & Nonbinary / Undetermined & Good & Yes\\\\\n\\hline\nMrs Davis & Mrs Davis & TV series & Feminine & Subjective & No\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Data cleaning\n\nBecause I collected the data myself, I knew I had all the variables I would need. The only thing to manipulate was the order of categorical variables and adding a numeric value to value-based categorical variables. The intentions of AI characters were converted to numeric values, with \"Bad\" at -1, \"Good\" at 1, and \"Subjective\" at 0. The same scale was used to convert the gender of the AI character to a numeric value, with \"Feminine\" at -1, \"Masculine\" at 1, and all others at 0. The variables for the creator's gender (man or not a man) and corporeal body were both converted into dummy variables.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nai <- ai_raw %>% \n  mutate(name = `Name of AI`,\n         med = factor(Medium, \n                      levels = c(\"film\", \n                                 \"book\", \n                                 \"TV series\", \n                                 \"short story\", \n                                 \"video game\", \n                                 \"novel series\")),\n         creatorMan = ifelse(`Author's gender` == \"Male\", 1, 0),\n         author = factor(ifelse(`Author's gender` == \"Male\", \n                                \"Creator was a Man\", \n                                \"Creator was NOT a Man\")),\n         aiGender = factor(`AI's perceived gender`),\n         body = ifelse(`Corporal body` == \"Yes\", 1, 0),\n         intent = factor(`Intentions toward humans`, \n                         levels = c('Bad', \n                                    'Good', \n                                    'Subjective'))) %>% \n  mutate(intentNUM = case_when(intent == \"Bad\" ~ -1,\n                               intent == \"Good\" ~ 1,\n                               TRUE ~ 0)) %>% \n  mutate(aigenderNUM = case_when(aiGender == \"Feminine\" ~ -1,\n                                 aiGender == \"Masculine\" ~ 1,\n                                 TRUE ~ 0)) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n# Individual figures\n\n## Figure 1: Time, Creator's Gender, AI's Gender, Corporal Status, and Intentions\n\nThe first figure serves as the main plot of the final graphic, and it attempts to convey the overall story of AI characters in science fiction. Each point is colored by the intention of the AI character from each source in a scatterplot with the earliest years at the top of the plot increasing down the graphic toward the present day. Shape is used to distinguish whether the character had a corporal body; empty points depict characters without a corporal body. The plot is faceted so that characters created by a male author appear on the left and characters created by anyone who was not a man appear on the right. Because there are many more examples written by men, the width of the facets has been adjusted to allow more room for the points on the left side. Each facet has three columns of jittered points to represent feminine, masculine, and nonbinary or undetermined genders of AI characters. Select labels have been added to points that represent popular examples of AI character source material. The labels for these points have been adjusted in the final image for readability, and in some cases, arrows have been added for clarity, along with other annotations.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na1 <- ai %>% \n  select(Year, intent, aiGender, med, body, \n         creatorMan, author, `Corporal body`) %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Year, aiGender, \n             color = intent, \n             fill = intent, \n             shape = factor(`Corporal body`))) +\n  geom_point(size = 5.5,\n             position = position_jitter(width = 0, \n                                        height = .2, \n                                        seed = 80085)) +\n  geom_label_repel(data = ai %>% filter(lab == \"Yes\"), \n                   aes(label = Source), \n                   seed = 50724,\n                   size = 3.75,\n                   color = \"white\",\n                   alpha = .85,\n                   fontface = \"bold\",\n                   box.padding = 0.15, \n                   label.padding = 0.15,\n                   show.legend\t= FALSE) +\n  facet_grid(~ author, switch=\"both\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors, \n                    guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors, \n                     guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1,21), \n                     guide = \"none\") +\n  scale_x_reverse(breaks = seq(1920,2020,10)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = label_wrap(12)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Year of Publication\",\n       y = NULL,\n       color = \"Intentions Toward Humans\",\n       shape = \"Corporal Body\",\n       caption = \"Empty points represent AI characters without a corporal body.\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"serif\", \n                             color = \"#310873\"),\n        title = element_text(size = 14, \n                             family = \"sans\", \n                             face = \"bold\", \n                             color = \"#310873\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 8, \n                                    color = \"#310873\",\n                                    family = \"sans\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10, \n                                    color = \"#310873\",\n                                    family = \"sans\"),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, \n                                   color = \"#310873\"),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, \n                                   color = \"#310873\"),\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"#E9E4FC\", \n                                          linetype = \"longdash\"),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(color = \"#E9E4FC\", \n                                          linetype = \"longdash\"),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        panel.border = element_blank(),\n        strip.text = element_text(color = \"#310873\", \n                                  face = \"bold\", \n                                  family = \"sans\",\n                                  size = 11),\n        strip.background = element_blank(),\n        plot.caption\t= element_text(size = 8, \n                                     family = \"serif\",\n                                     face = \"italic\",\n                                     hjust = 0))\na1\n\ngt = ggplot_gtable(ggplot_build(a1))\ngt$widths[5] = 1.5*gt$widths[5]\ngrid.draw(gt)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time, Creator's Gender, AI's Gender, Corporal Status, and Intentions](ai_files/figure-pdf/plot-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggsave(\"a1.png\", gt, width = 5.25, height = 8)\nggsave(\"a1.pdf\", gt, width = 5.25, height = 8)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Figure 2: Timeline Histogram\n\nThe second plot is used for reference in the final graphic.

The blue line clearly demonstrates that feminine AI characters with. a corporal body are more likely to have bad intentions; feminine AI characters without a corporal body almost always have good intentions. Nonbinary and AI characters with an undetermined gender are more likely to have good intentions, but the sample size for these characters is much smaller. For masculine AI characters, there is no clear distinction between their intentions based on whether they have a corporal body. Because intentions are not represented by color in this plot, this plot uses a different color palette to show that it is measuring different things.

It takes up about half of the page on the left side. This plot shows the most number of variables in the story (Time, Creator's Gender, AI's Gender, Corporal Status, and Intentions) to give the fullest visual description about the truth of AI and gender. Since we read left to right and top to bottom, placing this plot in the top left side of the graphic draws viewers' attention to it first. The legend for the colors is also positioned in the top left corner of the graphic for viewers to orient themselves to the meaning of each color before attempting to interpret the rest of the graphic. \n\nThe colors were chosen from an Adobe color palette to ensure they complemented and contrasted each other in a manner that is appealing to viewers. Fonts are contrasted by the purpose of the text; titles for each axis use a san serif font, while axis labels each use a serif font. Annotations use a serif font and the labels for selected examples on the main plot use a san serif font. The title of the graphic uses a monospace font; I chose this font for the title since AI is made from computers, and monospace fonts are the original computer font, so it seemed appropriate. The grid lines for each plot have been minimized or removed to allow the prominent data story to take center stage; they serve only as minimal background reference when necessary.\n\nFor fun, I created a collage of popular AI characters from film (and one novel) to add to the graphic. This visual may help viewers recognize a character or two they are familiar with from science fiction that they had not considered. The collage of recognizable characters also allows the viewer to appreciate the examples without interpreting a chart.\n\nThough this analysis is descriptive of a fictional genre, fiction can often convey more truth than we perceive in the real world. Fiction can reflect and amplify or even influence our understanding of truth and the constructs we use to describe that truth. As the patriarchy dominates and men benefit, the (mostly) men who create these characters and stories may not be conscious of an internal fear of powerful femininity, but they are influenced by the perceptions of gender in society, and the truth of the existence of a fear of a feminine body with ultimate power is evident in the correlation between feminine bodies and evil intentions of the AI characters in science fiction.\n\n![Killer Bodies: Artificial Intelligence, Gender, and Intentions](final_final.png)",
