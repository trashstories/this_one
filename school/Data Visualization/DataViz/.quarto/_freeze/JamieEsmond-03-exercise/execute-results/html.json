(Hint: group by both `Race` and `Film`.) Experiment with filling by `Race` or `Film` and faceting by `Race` or `Film`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](JamieEsmond-03-exercise_files/figure-html/film-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Race and gender and film\n\nCreate a plot that visualizes the number of words spoken by race, gender, and film simultaneously. Use the complete tidy `lotr` data frame. You don't need to create a new summarized dataset (with `group_by(Race, Gender, Film)`) because the original data already has a row for each of those (you could make a summarized dataset, but it would be identical to the full version).\n\nYou need to show `Race`, `Gender`, and `Film` at the same time, but you only have two possible aesthetics (`x` and `fill`), so you'll also need to facet by the third. Play around with different combinations (e.g. try `x = Race`, then `x = Film`) until you find one that tells the clearest story. For fun, add a `labs()` layer to add a title and subtitle and caption.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](JamieEsmond-03-exercise_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
