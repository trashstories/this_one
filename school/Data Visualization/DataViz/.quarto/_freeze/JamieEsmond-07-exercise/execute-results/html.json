How can you communicate the uncertainty in those relationships?  \nWhat are the dangers of visualizing two variables?  \nWhen is it appropriate to use two y-axes?  \n\n# Task 2: Combining plots\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(broom)\n\nresults_2016 <- read_csv(\"data/results_2016.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nMake 2--3 plots of anything you want from the `results_2016` data (histogram, density, boxplot, scatterplot, whatever) and combine them with {patchwork}. Look at [the documentation](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/guides/assembly.html) to see fancy ways of combining them, like having two rows inside a column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Make some plots and combine them here\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Task 3: Visualizing regression\n\n## Coefficient plot\n\nUse the `results_2016` data to create a model that predicts the percent of Democratic votes in a precinct based on age, race, income, rent, and state (hint: the formula will look like this: `percent_dem ~ median_age + percent_white + per_capita_income + median_rent + state`)\n\nUse `tidy()` in the {broom} package and `geom_pointrange()` to create a coefficient plot for the model estimates. You'll have 50 rows for all the states, and that's excessive for a plot like this, so you'll want to filter out the state rows. You can do that by adding this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntidy(...) %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(term, \"state\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `str_detect()` function looks for the characters \"state\" in the term column. The `!` negates it. This is thus saying \"only keep rows where the word 'state' is not in the term name\".\n\nYou should also get rid of the intercept (`filter(term != \"(Intercept)\")`).\n\n## Predicted values\n\nShow what happens to `percent_dem` as one (or more) of your model's variables changes. To make life easy, refer to the [\"Predicted values and marginal effects in 2023\"](https://datavizs23.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/07-example.html#predicted-values-and-marginal-effects-in-2023) section in this session's example and use `predictions()` rather than creating your own `newdata` data set by hand. You'll do something like this (assuming you're manipulating `per_capita_income`; try using a different variable when you do the assignment, though):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_predictions <- predictions(\n  model_name,\n  newdata = datagrid(per_capita_income = seq(9000, 60000, by = 100),\n                     state = \"Georgia\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlot your varied variable on the x-axis, the fitted values (`predicted`) on the y-axis, show the relationship with a line, and add a ribbon to show the 95% confidence interval.\n\n# Bonus task 1! Correlograms\n\n**This is entirely optional but might be fun.**\n\nFor extra fun times, if you feel like it, create a correlogram heatmap, either with `geom_tile()` or with points sized by the correlation. Use any variables you want from `results_2016`.\n\n# Bonus task 2! Marginal effects\n\n**This is also entirely optional but will be super useful if you use regression for anything in your own work.**\n\nFor extra super bonus fun times, create a more complex model that predicts `percent_dem` that uses polynomial terms (e.g. age squared) and/or interaction terms (e.g. age Ã— state). Plot predictions from the model, use `marginaleffects()` to find the slopes of those predictions at different values, and plot the slopes in a marginal effects plot. (The [\"Predicted values and marginal effects in 2023\"](https://datavizs23.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/07-example.html#predicted-values-and-marginal-effects-in-2023) section from the example will be indispensable here.)\n",
