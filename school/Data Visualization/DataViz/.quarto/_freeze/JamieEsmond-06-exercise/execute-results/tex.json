Even when dealing with data that represents something that has already happened, there are many reasons that the data could still have uncertainty. However, using data to predict the future may contain even more uncertainty.\n\nI actually really liked the 2016 election gauge. I can definitely understand why the confusion happened, but I think a simple disclaimer in the broadcast explaining what the jittering meant would have resolved that. My one critique of the visual is the use of the gauge symbol itself. Since gauges in the real world are used to measure things precisely, sometimes with extreme accuracy, you would not want the needle to be moving unless it was in real time. However, I believe that there may be other symbols that the data could have been mapped onto to better represent uncertainty. It might be interesting if there were liquid elements in a container (separated like oil and water), one red and one blue; the natural movement of the water where they meet would fluctuate around the estimation. This visual would be less likely to be interpreted as real time changes, but as the night goes on the waves lessen and the uncertainty window is narrowed, like the settling of liquid over time; more uncertainty = larger, unsteady waves, and as the margin closes, calmer, steadier liquid.\n\n\\newpage\n\n# Task 2: Visualizing uncertainty with gapminder\n\nFor this exercise you'll revisit Hans Rosling's gapminder data on health and wealth. Install the {gapminder} package if you haven't already. Also install the {ggridges} and {gghalves} packages.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # For ggplot, dplyr, and friends\nlibrary(gapminder)  # For health/wealth data\nlibrary(ggridges)   # For ridge plots\nlibrary(gghalves)   # For half geoms\nlibrary(scales)\n\ncolors <- c(\"#7400CC\", \"#3ACC14\", \"#CC0AA4\", \"#CCAC14\", \"#0E0ACC\")\n\ndllr <- label_number(accuracy = 0, prefix = \"$\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Histograms\n\nMake a histogram of *logged* GDP per capita for 1997 only, across all five continents.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a filtered dataset\n\ng97 <- gapminder %>% \n  filter(year == 1997)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Add a histogram here.
